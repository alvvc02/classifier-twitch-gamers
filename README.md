Classifier for Twitch Gamers

Introduction
This project focuses on developing a classification model to analyze Twitch channels and predict which ones are likely to become affiliates. By examining key characteristics and relationships between channels, the classifier aims to determine which features are significant in identifying affiliate-worthy channels on the platform. The model is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for data analysis and experimentation with different machine learning techniques.

Features
Analyze characteristics and relationships between Twitch channels
Classification model using Jupyter Notebooks
Focus on predicting potential affiliation of channels based on various parameters

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

Install the necessary dependencies:
Installation
To set up and run the classifier locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/alvvc02/classifier-twitch-gamers.git
cd classifier-twitch-gamers
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
For Python 3.x, use:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Since there is no requirements.txt file, manually install the required libraries. Based on the project’s nature, the likely libraries include:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib
If there are additional libraries needed, refer to the imports in the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Start Jupyter Notebook
Once the environment is set up, launch Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the code:
jupyter notebook
5. Running the Classifier
Navigate to the notebook file and execute the cells to train and evaluate the Twitch channel classification model.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the classifier on Twitch channel data. You can modify the dataset and features to experiment with different classification models.
